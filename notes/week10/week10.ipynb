    "The first example is the halting problem. In many textbooks (and the poem \"Scooping the Loop Snooper\"), the halting problem is actually the prototypical undecidable language, but Sipser does things a little differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof is not difficult but it has a weird feel to it. The first thing that you have to remember is that the direction of the reduction is the opposite of what most people intuitively think of first. If you want to show that the halting problem is undecidable, you do _not_ reduce the halting problem to $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. You assume that the halting problem _is_ decidable, then show via a reduction from $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ to the halting problem that $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$ would also be decidable, which is a contradiction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that we designed $U$, a universal TM, that _recognizes_ $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$, but we showed that we cannot design a TM $S$ that _decides_ $A_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. Practically, the sticking point is that on input $\\langle M, w\\rangle$, if $M$ loops on $w$, we have no way to detect it so that we can reject. Enter $R$, a hypothetical TM that decides the halting problem $\\mathit{HALT}_{\\mathsf{TM}}$. If we had such a machine, then designing $S$ would be easy: Use $R$ to check for looping. if a loop is detected, reject; if no loop is detected, we can safely simulate $M$ and return what it returns. But last time we showed (by diagonalization) that $S$ does not exist. Therefore, $R$ cannot exist either."

    "The flaw in the above proof is simply that $M$ itself might erase. And if $M'$ uses its own tape to simulate $M$'s tape, as would be natural to do, then there's a potential bug: if $M$ erases a symbol but ultimately rejects, then $M'$, too, will erase a symbol inadvertently. To fix the flaw, simply define a \"virtual blank symbol\" $b$, and if $M$ ever erases, then $M'$ should write $b$ instead of a real blank."
